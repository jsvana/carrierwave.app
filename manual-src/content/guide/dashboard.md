The Dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of your logging activity and service status.

## Activity Grid

At the top of the Dashboard, a GitHub-style activity grid shows your logging history over the past 26-52 weeks. Green cells represent activation days, blue cells represent activity log (hunter) days, and cells with a diagonal split mean you did both.

Tap any cell to see that day's details.

## Activity Statistics

Below the grid, the statistics display shows your QSO counts across several dimensions:

### By Band
How many contacts on each band (20m, 40m, 2m, etc.). Tap any band to drill down and see those specific contacts.

### By Mode
Contacts broken down by mode (SSB, CW, FT8, FM). See where you spend most of your time.

### By Country
Your DXCC entity count. Working toward 100 countries for the {{< term "DXCC" >}} award? Track your progress here.

### Other Stats
- **Grid Squares** — Unique grids worked
- **Parks** — POTA parks worked or activated
- **States** — Progress toward WAS
- **QRZ QSLs** — Confirmed contacts on QRZ
- **LoTW QSLs** — Confirmed contacts on LoTW

## Streaks

The configurable metrics card shows your current streaks — consecutive days with specific types of activity. Streak types include On-Air, Activation, Hunter, CW, Phone, and Digital. Tap to see detailed breakdowns with mode and band splits, date ranges, and all-time best comparisons.

## Service Status

The Services section shows sync status for each connected service:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Green dot** | Synced and current |
| **Yellow dot** | Sync in progress |
| **Red dot** | Error (tap for details) |
| **Gray dot** | Not configured |

Tap any service to see details about the last sync, pending uploads, sync reports with a visual funnel, or force a re-download.

## Conditions

If you have solar polling enabled, a conditions card shows the latest K-index, SFI, and A-index values with sparkline charts. Tap to see a full conditions history with timeline charts and by-location comparisons.
