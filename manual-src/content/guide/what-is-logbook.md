A logbook is your radio diary - a record of every conversation ({{< term "QSO" >}}) you have on the air.

## Why Keep a Log?

Amateur radio operators have kept logs since the earliest days of radio. While the FCC no longer requires US hams to maintain a log, there are many good reasons to do so:

**Track your progress.** See how your skills improve over time. Watch your contact count grow. Celebrate milestones.

**Confirm contacts.** Many awards and achievements require proof that contacts actually happened. When both stations log the same QSO with matching details, that contact is "confirmed."

**Remember your conversations.** Years from now, you'll enjoy looking back at your first DX contact, your first CW QSO, or that memorable ragchew.

**Participate in events.** Contests, activations like {{< term "POTA" >}}, and special events all require logging.

## From Paper to Digital

Traditionally, hams kept paper logs - notebooks with columns for date, time, callsign, frequency, and notes. Many still do!

Digital logging offers advantages:

- **Automatic lookups** - Get name, location, and other info instantly
- **Cloud backup** - Never lose your log to fire, flood, or hard drive failure
- **Easy search** - Find any contact in seconds
- **Electronic confirmations** - No postage required

Carrier Wave is a digital logger that syncs to multiple cloud services, giving you the best of both worlds: the immediacy of mobile logging with the permanence of cloud storage.
