Your contacts live on your phone, but they're also valuable in the cloud. Here's why.

## The Confirmation Problem

You logged a QSO with W1AW. You know it happened. But how does anyone else know?

**Confirmation** is when both stations submit matching log entries for the same contact. When the time, frequency, and callsigns match, that QSO is "confirmed" - there's proof from both sides that it occurred.

Confirmations matter for:
- **Awards** like {{< term "DXCC" >}} (100 countries) or {{< term "WAS" >}} (50 states)
- **POTA** hunter and activator credits
- **Contest scoring** verification

## The Services

Carrier Wave syncs with several cloud logging services, each serving a different purpose:

### QRZ.com

The most popular general-purpose logbook. QRZ provides:
- Callsign lookups (name, address, license info)
- Online logbook viewable by anyone
- Basic confirmation matching

**Sync direction:** Upload and download

### Logbook of The World (LoTW)

ARRL's official confirmation system. LoTW is the gold standard for award credits:
- Digitally signed confirmations
- Required for many ARRL awards
- Highest trust level in the hobby

**Sync direction:** Download only (upload via ARRL tools)

### Parks on the Air (POTA)

If you activate parks or hunt park stations, POTA tracking is essential:
- Activator logs uploaded here
- Hunter credits automatically applied
- Park-to-park tracking

**Sync direction:** Upload only

### Ham2K LoFi

A modern logging service designed for mobile operators:
- Fast sync across all your devices
- Works great with field logging
- Clean, simple interface

**Sync direction:** Upload and download

### Club Log

A logbook service popular with DXers:
- Bidirectional {{< term "ADIF" >}} sync
- Batch upload and incremental download
- Real-time single-QSO upload

**Sync direction:** Upload and download

### HAMRS

Cloud sync for HAMRS users:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Field logging focused

**Sync direction:** Download

## Why Multiple Services?

Each service has strengths. You might:
- Use **QRZ** as your primary logbook
- Upload activations to **POTA**
- Download confirmations from **LoTW**
- Sync across devices with **LoFi**
- Mirror your log to **Club Log** for DX tracking

Carrier Wave handles all of this automatically. Log once, sync everywhere.
