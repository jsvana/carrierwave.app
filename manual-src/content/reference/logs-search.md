The Logs tab provides powerful search and filtering capabilities for exploring your QSO history, with full {{< term "ADIF" >}} metadata display and sync status tracking.

## Log List

The default view shows your most recent contacts in reverse chronological order. Each entry displays:

- **Callsign** (with nickname if available from callsign notes, and emoji if configured)
- **Contact count badge** (bronze at 10 QSOs, silver at 25, gold at 50)
- **Date and time** (UTC)
- **Frequency** (if logged)
- **Band and mode**
- **RST exchanged**
- **Park references** (POTA, with park names when available)
- **SOTA reference** (if applicable)
- **WWFF reference** (if applicable)
- **Sync status indicators** (one badge per service)

Tap any entry to view the full QSO detail.

## Search

The search bar supports two modes: simple callsign search and structured query language.

### Simple Search (Implicit Callsign Search)

When you enter plain text without field qualifiers, Carrier Wave treats it as a callsign prefix search:

```
W1AW
K6TEST
VE3
```

- Text is automatically uppercased
- Acts as `callsign:<text>*` wildcard search
- Searches across their call, your call, and operator call fields
- An info note appears when using implicit callsign search

### Query Language

For precise searches, use field-specific queries.

### Quick Filters

The filter menu (three horizontal lines icon) provides common search presets:

- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- This year
- CW contacts
- FT8 contacts
- SSB contacts
- POTA activations
- LoTW confirmed
- Pending upload

Tap a quick filter to populate the search bar.

### Performance Warnings

Carrier Wave analyzes your query and warns about potentially slow searches. Warnings appear when:

- Searching a large log (>5,000 QSOs) without indexed field filters
- Using only non-indexed fields (e.g., notes, grid)
- Full-table scans are required

When warned:

- Click **Search Anyway** to proceed
- Click **Add Date Filter** to add `after:30d` and narrow results
- Add field-specific filters (callsign, band, mode, date) for better performance

**Performance note:** Field-specific queries use database predicates for efficient full-table search. Simple callsign searches and indexed field queries execute quickly even on large logs.

### Help Sheet

Tap the filter menu and select **Search Help** to view the syntax reference in-app.

## QSO Detail View

Tap any contact to view the full QSO record. The detail view shows:

### Header
- **Callsign** (large, monospaced)
- **Name** (if available)
- **Location** (QTH, state, country)
- **License class** (if known)

### Contact Section
- **Date and time** (UTC)
- **Band and mode**
- **Frequency** (if logged)
- **RST sent and received**
- **Power** (if logged)
- **Radio/rig** (if logged)

### Location Section
- **My grid** (Maidenhead locator)
- **Their grid**
- **My park** (POTA reference, with name)
- **Their park** (for P2P contacts)
- **SOTA reference** (if applicable)
- **WWFF reference** (if applicable)
- **DXCC entity** (country name and number)

### Notes Section
- **Notes** (free-form text, if present)

### Sync Status Section

Shows per-service sync indicators:

- **Service badges** (colored pills showing status)
- **Status text** (Present, Submitted, Rejected, Pending Upload)
- **Last confirmed date** (if available)
- **Confirmation stars** (LoTW, QRZ QSL, eQSL)

**Badge colors:**

- **Green:** Present/synced
- **Blue:** Submitted, awaiting confirmation
- **Orange:** Pending upload (service configured)
- **Gray:** Pending upload (service not configured)

### Source Section
- **Import source** (Logger, LoFi, QRZ, POTA, eQSL, etc.)
- **Imported date**
- **QRZ Log ID** (if synced from QRZ)
- **Raw {{< term "ADIF" >}}** (expandable disclosure for debugging)

### Actions

From the QSO detail view, you can:

- **Edit** -- Modify any field (changes saved locally and re-queued for sync)
- **Delete** -- Soft delete (hides QSO, prevents future sync)

## Editing QSOs

Tap **Edit** from the detail view to modify any field. Changes are:

1. **Saved locally** to your SwiftData store
2. **Re-queued for sync** to services that support updates (QRZ, POTA, Club Log, eQSL)

**Note:** Some services don't support updating previously uploaded QSOs. Updates may only apply to future uploads.

## Deleting QSOs

Tap **Delete** from the detail view to remove a contact.

**Deletion behavior:**

- **Soft delete** -- QSOs are hidden, not permanently removed from the database
- **Hidden QSOs** don't appear in lists, stats, maps, or activations
- **Sync prevention** -- Hidden QSOs won't sync to cloud services
- **Reversible** -- View and restore hidden QSOs in **Settings -> Developer -> Hidden QSOs**

**Important:** Deletion does NOT remove QSOs from cloud services. Most services (QRZ, POTA, LoTW) don't support remote deletion via API.

## Sessions Tab

The Sessions tab (within Logs) provides a browsable history of all completed logging sessions, grouped by month.

### Session List

Each session row shows:

- **Date and time**
- **Activation type** (POTA, Rove, Hunter, General)
- **Park reference(s)** (for POTA activations)
- **QSO count**
- **QSO timeline** (horizontal bar showing contact timing and band changes)
- **Conditions badges** (solar and weather indicators)
- **Equipment badges** (radio, antenna, key/mic)
- **Recording indicator** (microphone icon if WebSDR recording exists)
- **Upload status** (for POTA sessions: pending, completed, failed)

### Session Grouping

Sessions are grouped by month in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

### Recording Navigation

Sessions with WebSDR recordings show a microphone icon. Tap the session to:

- Navigate to the **Recording Player** (full-screen with transport controls)
- View the **QSO list** synced to recording timestamps
- **Share clips** (select range, export M4A)

See [WebSDR Recording](/reference/websdr/) for details.

### Import ADIF into Session

Long-press any session to reveal the **Import ADIF** option. This lets you import an ADIF file directly into an existing session, merging the contacts with the session's existing QSOs.

**Validation warnings:** If the imported ADIF contains QSOs with a different callsign or park reference than the session, Carrier Wave displays a warning before proceeding. You can choose to continue or cancel the import.

This is useful when you have QSOs logged in another app during an activation and want to consolidate them into a single session.

### Session Detail

Tap any session to view:

- **Full equipment list**
- **Session photos** (with full-screen viewer)
- **Notes** (operator comments)
- **Persisted spots** (RBN and POTA spots captured during the session)
- **QSO list** (expandable rows with swipe-to-delete)
- **Edit button** (modify equipment, photos, notes)

For **POTA activations**, the detail view additionally shows:

- **Upload button** (submit to POTA)
- **Reject option** (mark QSOs as hidden, prevent upload)
- **Share card** (generate brag sheet with map and stats)
- **Export ADIF** (download activation log for offline use)
- **Activation statistics** (charts, distance histogram, rate analysis)

See [Service Sync Flow](/reference/sync-flow/) for POTA upload details.
