Carrier Wave provides iOS home screen widgets, lock screen widgets, a Live Activity feature, and a watchOS companion app to surface key information without opening the app. All widgets use an App Group for shared data access, enabling real-time updates.

---

## Live Activity

Live Activity displays an active logging session on the lock screen and in the Dynamic Island. It appears automatically when you start a logging session and updates in real time as you log {{< term "QSO" >}}s.

### What It Shows

- Current {{< term "QSO" >}} count for the session
- Operating frequency and {{< term "mode" >}}
- Park reference (for {{< term "POTA" >}} activations)
- Last {{< term "callsign" >}} logged
- Session duration timer

### Real-Time Updates

The Live Activity updates immediately when:

- A {{< term "QSO" >}} is logged
- Frequency or {{< term "mode" >}} changes
- Session is paused or resumed
- A milestone is reached (e.g., 10th QSO for POTA activation)

If the app is terminated and relaunched during an active session, the Live Activity reconnects automatically.

### Dynamic Island

On devices with Dynamic Island, the Live Activity provides:

- **Compact view:** Minimal session info ({{< term "QSO" >}} count and park reference)
- **Expanded view:** Full session details including frequency, {{< term "mode" >}}, last {{< term "callsign" >}}, and session duration
- **Minimal view:** QSO count only (when other Live Activities compete for space)

### Ending the Activity

The Live Activity clears automatically when:

- You end the logging session
- The session is deleted
