## Overview

Period brag sheets are shareable image cards summarizing your operating achievements over a specific time window — **this week**, **this month**, or **all time**. Unlike activation brag sheets (which cover a single {{< term "POTA" >}} session), period brag sheets aggregate across all your {{< term "QSO" >}}s to surface personal records, milestones, and bragging rights.

Access period brag sheets from the **Dashboard** toolbar or the **Logs** tab share menu.

## Time Windows

Each brag sheet covers one of three periods:

- **Weekly** — Monday 0000Z through Sunday 2359Z (current or most recent complete week)
- **Monthly** — First through last day of the calendar month (UTC)
- **All Time** — Every {{< term "QSO" >}} in your log

The selected period applies to all stats on the card. Where relevant, stats show the specific date and {{< term "QSO" >}} that achieved the record.

## Stats Categories

### Speed & Rate

Metrics that highlight how fast you operate.

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fastest 10 QSOs** | Shortest elapsed time to log 10 consecutive contacts within a single session. Shows the session, date, and elapsed time (e.g., "10 QSOs in 8m 22s"). |
| **Peak 15-Minute Rate** | Highest number of {{< term "QSO" >}}s logged in any 15-minute sliding window. Expressed as raw count and projected hourly rate (e.g., "12 QSOs / 48 per hr"). |
| **Best Session Rate** | Highest average QSOs/hour for any session with 10+ contacts. Excludes idle gaps longer than 15 minutes. |
| **Fastest Activation** | Shortest time from first to tenth {{< term "QSO" >}} in a {{< term "POTA" >}} activation (time to valid activation). |

### Distance

How far your signal reached.

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Furthest Contact** | Maximum distance {{< term "QSO" >}}, computed from {{< term "Maidenhead grid" >}} squares. Shows callsign, distance (km/mi), and band. |
| **Furthest Contact per Band** | Best DX on each band you've operated. Compact table with band → callsign → distance. |
| **Furthest QRP Contact** | Longest-distance {{< term "QSO" >}} made at 5 watts or less. |
| **Total Distance** | Cumulative distance across all {{< term "QSO" >}}s in the period. Fun stat — "Your signals traveled 142,000 km this month." |

### Power & Efficiency

Doing more with less.

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Lowest Power Contact** | {{< term "QSO" >}} made at the lowest transmit power. Shows watts, callsign, distance, and band. |
| **Best Watts-per-Mile** | Most efficient contact: lowest ratio of transmit power to distance. Rewards QRP DX. (e.g., "0.003 W/mi — 5W to JA1ABC at 5,400 mi on 20m"). |
| **QRP QSO Count** | Number of contacts made at 5W or less. |
| **Milliwatt QSO Count** | Number of contacts made at less than 1W. |

| **Worked All States Progress** | X/50 US states confirmed — progress bar if enabled. |

### Volume & Consistency

Raw operating output.

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total QSOs** | Contact count for the period. |
| **Most QSOs in a Day** | Best single UTC day by contact count. Shows date and count. |

| **Operating Days** | Number of distinct UTC days with at least one QSO. |
| **Active Bands** | Number of distinct bands used in the period. |
| **Active Modes** | Number of distinct modes used in the period. |

### Streaks

Consistency is its own flex.

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|

| **Best On-Air Streak** | Longest streak in the period (or all-time). |
| **Current Activation Streak** | Consecutive days with a {{< term "POTA" >}} activation. |
| **Mode Streaks** | Longest streak for CW, Phone, and Digital individually. |

### POTA

## Brag Sheet Layout

### Card Structure

Period brag sheets follow a consistent visual layout:

**Header**

- Period label (e.g., "Week of Feb 17–23, 2026" or "February 2026" or "All Time")
- Carrier Wave branding

**Hero Stats Row**
- 3–4 headline numbers displayed large: Total QSOs, Furthest Contact, DXCC Entities, Best Rate
- These serve as the visual anchor of the card

**Records Section**
- Personal records achieved during the period
- Each record shows the stat, value, and the specific QSO or session that earned it
- Gold highlight for all-time records that were set or broken during this period

**Activity Visualization**

- Monthly: day-by-day activity grid (calendar heatmap)
- All Time: band/mode distribution pie charts

**Map** (optional, toggleable)
- World map with contact markers and arcs
- Same RST color coding as activation brag sheets

**Footer**
- Date generated
- Carrier Wave logo

### Customization

In **Settings → Brag Sheets**:

- **Include Map** — Toggle map visualization on/off (default: on)
