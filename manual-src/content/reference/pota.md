Carrier Wave provides full-featured POTA activation logging with auto-spotting, rove mode, cloud upload, and detailed activation analytics.

## Starting a POTA Activation

### Activation Type

Set {{< term "Session Type" >}} to **POTA** in the session start wizard. This enables park-specific features including auto-spotting, upload tracking, and activation statistics.

### Park Reference Entry

Enter one or more park references using any of these methods:

- **Manual entry**: Type a full reference (e.g., `US-1234`) or use shorthand (`1234` auto-expands to `US-1234`)
- **Search by name or number**: Start typing to search all POTA parks by name or reference
- **Nearby parks**: Enable location services to see parks sorted by proximity to your current GPS position

### Multi-Park Activations (n-fers)

Select multiple parks to activate simultaneously. Parks appear as removable chips in the session header. When you post a spot, it goes to **all** selected parks at once.

Tap the **×** on a park chip to remove it from the activation. This is useful for transitioning between parks in rove mode or correcting an accidental selection.

### Hunt-First Flow

If you don't know your operating frequency yet, skip frequency entry at session start. Set it later using the `BAND` command or manual frequency picker. This supports hunt-first activation workflows where you tune around before settling on a frequency.

### Park Detail Sheet

Tap any park chip to open the park detail sheet showing:

- POTA statistics for the park
- Top activators and hunters leaderboard
- Recent activations with dates and callsigns

## Rove Mode

Rove mode lets you activate multiple parks sequentially in a single session, with automatic tracking of which {{< term "QSO" >}}s belong to which park stop.

### Starting a Rove

Add multiple parks at session start, or add parks on-the-fly during the session. Use **Next Stop** to transition between parks.

### Rove Progress Bar

A horizontally scrolling progress bar shows each stop as a pill, with:

- Park reference and QSO count
- Current stop highlighted
- Scroll left/right to see all stops

### Per-Stop Tracking

Each stop tracks:

- QSOs logged at this location
- GPS grid (auto-updated when transitioning)
- Start/end timestamps
- Frequency and mode changes

### Automatic Spot Management

When you transition to the next park:

- A **QRT** spot is posted for the previous park
- A new **initial spot** is posted for the current park
- The auto-spot timer resets

### Duplicate Detection

Duplicate callsign detection is **per park stop**. If you work the same station at multiple stops, only the first QSO at each park is flagged as a duplicate. This prevents false warnings when moving between parks.

### UTC Midnight Splitting

Sessions spanning UTC midnight are automatically split into separate activations, ensuring each activation covers only one UTC date. This matches POTA's requirement that activations run from 0000-2359 UTC on a single day.

### Rove Map Visualization

Use the `MAP` command to see your rove route:

- Numbered markers for each stop
- Dashed line connecting stops in sequence
- QSO locations overlaid on the route

## Auto-Spotting

Carrier Wave posts spots automatically during POTA sessions.

### Initial Spot

When you start a session, an initial spot is posted immediately (if you've set a frequency). For multi-park activations, the spot includes all park references.

### Periodic Spots

The auto-spot timer posts a spot every **10 minutes** (configurable in Settings → POTA). This keeps your activation visible in the spot feed.

The timer:

- Pauses when the session is paused
- Resumes when the session resumes
- Resets on QSY or park transitions

### QSY Spots

When you change frequency or mode, Carrier Wave prompts you to post a **QSY spot**. This notifies hunters of your new frequency.

### QRT Spots

When you end a session, a **QRT spot** is posted automatically (if the session was previously spotted). This can be disabled in Settings → POTA.

### Manual Spots with SPOT Command

Use `SPOT` to post a manual spot with an optional comment:

- `SPOT` — post a basic spot
- `SPOT QRT` — post a QRT spot immediately
- `SPOT QSY 14.062` — post a QSY spot with new frequency

## Spot Comments

POTA supports comments on spots, which Carrier Wave fetches and displays during active sessions.

### Background Polling

While a session is active, Carrier Wave polls for new spot comments in the background. This happens automatically without user intervention.

### Spot Comments Button

A button in the session header shows the count of new comments. Tap to open the comments sheet.

### Comments Sheet

The comments sheet shows:

- Hunter feedback and messages
- Consecutive RBN (Reverse Beacon Network) spots collapsed into expandable groups
- Average CW speed (WPM) calculated from RBN spots
- Timestamp and callsign for each comment

### Auto-Attach to QSOs

Comments are automatically attached as notes to matching {{< term "QSO" >}}s (matched by callsign and timestamp proximity). This preserves hunter feedback with the logged contact.

## Sessions View

The Sessions view shows all POTA activations alongside other session types in a unified list.

### Session Row Content

Each session row displays:

- Park reference(s) and activation date
- QSO count and timeline visualization
- Upload status badges (pending, submitted, accepted)
- Equipment badges (antenna, key, mic)
- Photo count badge
- Conditions summary (solar index, weather)
- Recording player (compact inline waveform)

### Session Detail

Tap a session to see:

- Full equipment list
- Attached photos
- Notes and observations
- Persisted spots from the session
- Complete QSO list with expand-to-see-all-fields
- Edit button (modifies park reference, date, notes)
- Statistics section (when Professional Statistician Mode is enabled)

### Swipe to Delete

Swipe left on a session to reveal the delete button. A confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion.

### Professional Statistician Mode

When enabled in Settings → POTA, session detail includes:

- Band distribution chart
- Mode distribution chart
- Distance CDF (cumulative distribution function)
- Timing CDF (inter-QSO intervals)
- RST statistics (sent/received averages)
- Entity count (DXCC, states, provinces)

## Upload Workflow

Carrier Wave uploads POTA activations to the POTA servers via {{< term "Ham2K LoFi" >}}.

### QSO Grouping

QSOs are grouped by:

- Park reference
- UTC date

Each group becomes a separate ADIF file for upload. For two-fer activations, QSOs are duplicated and uploaded to each park separately.

### Upload Status

Each activation shows one of three states:

- **Pending** — QSOs have not been uploaded
- **Submitted** — QSOs uploaded, waiting for POTA processing (blue clock icon)
- **Accepted** — POTA has accepted the activation

### Upload Prompt

When you end a session, a sheet prompts you to upload immediately or defer. The sheet includes:

- Scrollable content showing all activations
- Expandable detents (half-height, full-screen)
- Upload, reject, or export buttons

### Bulk Actions

In the Activations view, use multi-select mode to:

- Upload multiple activations at once
- Mark activations as rejected (won't upload)
- Export multiple activations to ADIF

## Upload Status & Jobs

POTA upload jobs are tracked and displayed in the Activations view.

### Job Matching

Jobs are matched to activations by:

- Park reference
- UTC date
- Callsign

This ensures upload status is accurate even for multi-day or multi-park sessions.

### Job Status Display

Each activation shows:

- Job ID and submission timestamp
- Processing status (queued, processing, completed, failed)
- Error messages (if any)

A **warning icon** appears on activations with failed jobs. Tap to see the full POTA error message inline (e.g., "Duplicate activation detected" or "Invalid park reference").

### Reconciliation

During sync, Carrier Wave reconciles upload status from the POTA job log:

- Submitted QSOs are matched to completed jobs and marked as accepted
- Orphaned submitted QSOs (where POTA silently dropped the upload) are reset to pending

### Force Reupload (Debug Mode)

In Settings → Advanced → Debug Mode, a **Force Reupload** button resets all QSOs in the activation to pending and triggers a fresh upload. Use this if upload status is out of sync.

### Maintenance Window Handling

POTA servers are offline from **2330-0400 UTC** for maintenance. If you end a session during this window, Carrier Wave warns you and suggests uploading later.
