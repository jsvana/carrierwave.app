The Activity Log provides an always-on daily {{< term "QSO" >}} tracking workflow designed for hunters who make contacts throughout the day without the overhead of starting and stopping logging sessions.

## Overview

Unlike the session-based Logger, the Activity Log operates continuously. You set up your station once, then log {{< term "QSO" >}}s as you make them. Perfect for:

- **Hunting activators** throughout the day
- **Casual operating** without session structure
- **Daily goal tracking** (e.g., "50 QSOs today")
- **Drop-in contacts** while monitoring the bands

No need to start a session, manage metadata, or stop logging. Just make contacts and log them.

## Getting Started

### First Use Setup

The first time you access Activity Log, a setup sheet guides you through:

1. **Your name** - Operator name for the log
2. **Your callsign** - Station callsign
3. **Station profile** - Select or create your first equipment profile

### Dashboard Card

The Activity Log dashboard card displays:

- **Setup prompt** if not yet configured
- **Today's statistics** once set up (QSO count, bands worked, goal progress)

Tap the card to open the Activity Log view.

## Station Profiles

Station profiles are reusable equipment configurations that apply to all {{< term "QSO" >}}s logged while that profile is active.

### Profile Components

Each profile stores:

- **Radio** - Transceiver model
- **Antenna** - Antenna type and configuration
- **Key** - CW key or paddle (optional)
- **Mic** - Microphone model (optional)
- **Power** - Output power in watts
- **Grid square** - Station location (Maidenhead locator)

### Creating Profiles

Tap **Station Profiles** in Activity Log settings to add or edit profiles.

**Use Current Location:** Tap this button to auto-populate the grid square from {{< term "GPS" >}} coordinates. Requires location permissions.

### Selecting a Profile

Before logging {{< term "QSO" >}}s, pick a station profile. This sets the equipment configuration for the day. When you change profiles, all subsequent {{< term "QSO" >}}s use the new profile's settings.

Profiles are stored in UserDefaults and persist across app launches.

## Quick Entry

The Activity Log's quick entry field supports intelligent parsing of contact details.

### Entry Format

Type a single line containing callsign and optional details:

```
W1AW 579 WA US-0189
```

The parser extracts:
- **Callsign:** W1AW
- **{{< term "RST" >}}:** 579 (sent and received)
- **State:** WA
- **Park:** US-0189

### Token Preview

As you type, the field displays color-coded token pills showing what the parser detected:

- **Blue** - Callsign
- **Green** - {{< term "RST" >}}
- **Purple** - State/Province
- **Orange** - Park reference
- **Yellow** - Frequency

This visual feedback confirms the parser understood your input correctly.

### RST Handling

**Single {{< term "RST" >}}:** Applies to both sent and received reports.

```
K1ABC 599
```
Results in: Sent 599, Received 599.

**Two RST values:** The first becomes sent, the second received.

```
K1ABC 579 599
```
Results in: Sent 579, Received 599.

### Frequency Entry

Include frequency in MHz to auto-populate band:

```
W1AW 14.060
```

The parser shows:
- **Frequency:** 14.060 MHz
- **Band:** 20m (pill badge)

### Number Row Keyboard

The quick entry field displays a custom keyboard accessory row with number keys (0-9) for rapid {{< term "RST" >}} and frequency entry.

### Band & Mode Indicator

Below the quick entry field, a status line shows:

> Next QSO will be logged as: **20m CW**

This confirms the band and mode that will apply to the {{< term "QSO" >}} when saved. Change band/mode using the picker controls above the entry field.

## Spot List

The Activity Log includes a hunter-focused spot list showing active stations to work.

### Spot Sources

Spots come from:

- **{{< term "POTA" >}}** - Parks on the Air activators
- **{{< term "RBN" >}}** - Reverse Beacon Network

### Worked-Before Badges

Each spot displays badges indicating your contact history:

- **DUPE** - Already worked this callsign on this band today
- **TODAY** - Worked this callsign on a different band today
- **PREV** - Worked this callsign on a previous day

This helps you prioritize new contacts and avoid accidental duplicates.

### Spot Deduplication

The spot list combines {{< term "POTA" >}} and {{< term "RBN" >}} spots intelligently:

- Spots with the **same callsign + band** are merged into a single entry
- **{{< term "POTA" >}} source preferred** when available (shows park reference)
- {{< term "RBN" >}} data supplements {{< term "POTA" >}} spots with signal strength

### Tapping a Spot

Tap any spot to open a half-sheet {{< term "QSO" >}} entry form pre-filled with:

- **Callsign** from the spot
- **Frequency** from the spot
- **Mode** from the spot
- **Park reference** (if {{< term "POTA" >}} spot)

Make the contact, then save the {{< term "QSO" >}}.

## Spot Filtering

Customize which spots appear using the filter controls.

### Source Filter

- **{{< term "POTA" >}}** - Show only Parks on the Air activators
- **{{< term "RBN" >}}** - Show only Reverse Beacon Network spots
- **All** - Show both sources (with deduplication)

### Band Filter

Select one or more amateur bands:

- 160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m, 6m, 2m

### Mode Filter

- **CW** - Morse code
- **SSB** - Voice (single sideband)
- **FT8** - Digital weak-signal
- **FT4** - Fast digital
- **All** - Any mode

### Age Filter

Show spots heard within the last N minutes. Configurable range: **5-30 minutes** (default: ≤12 minutes).

Older spots are often no longer active.

### Proximity Filter

**Heard Nearby** mode filters spots to stations within a configurable radius of your location.

- **Radius range:** 100-2000 miles
- **Default:** Disabled (show all spots)

When enabled, only spots within the radius appear. Useful for regional hunting or skip analysis.

### Sort Order

- **Recent** - Newest spots first (default)
- **Frequency** - Ascending frequency order

### Hide Already Worked

Toggle **Hide Already Worked** to filter out spots with DUPE, TODAY, or PREV badges.

### Spot Age Color Coding

Spot rows use color to indicate freshness:

- **Green** - Less than 2 minutes old
- **Blue** - 2-10 minutes old
- **Orange** - 10-30 minutes old
- **Gray** - More than 30 minutes old

### SELF Badge

If your own callsign appears in the spot list (e.g., from {{< term "RBN" >}} receivers hearing your CQ), it displays a **SELF** badge.

### Default Filter Settings

On first use, spot filtering defaults to:

- **Source:** {{< term "POTA" >}}
- **Band:** 20m
- **Mode:** CW
- **Age:** ≤12 minutes
- **Proximity:** Heard Nearby (enabled)
- **Sort:** Recent
- **Hide Already Worked:** Enabled

Adjust these to match your hunting preferences.

## Band Timeline

The Activity Log displays a horizontal band timeline visualization showing your activity throughout the day.

### Timeline Display

Each band (20m, 40m, etc.) gets a row. Colored segments indicate periods when you logged {{< term "QSO" >}}s on that band.

**Segment length** corresponds to the time span of contacts. Gaps indicate times when you weren't active on that band.

### Color Coding

Each band uses a distinct color for quick visual reference.

### Use Cases

- **Review your operating patterns** (e.g., "I operated 20m from 1400-1800Z")
- **Identify band conditions** (short bursts vs sustained activity)
- **Plan future operations** based on successful time blocks

## Daily Summary

Tap **View Full Day** to see a complete summary of the current day's activity.

### Summary Components

The daily summary includes:

- **Band timeline** - Visual activity breakdown
- **QSO list** - All contacts made today, sorted by time
- **Statistics** - Total QSOs, bands worked, countries worked

### QSO List

Each {{< term "QSO" >}} row shows:

- **Callsign**
- **Band + Mode** (e.g., "20m CW")
- **Time** (UTC)
- **Park reference** (if applicable)
- **State/Province** (if logged)

### Date Navigation

Use the date picker to browse previous days' activity. The timeline and {{< term "QSO" >}} list update to reflect the selected date.

Historical data persists as long as the {{< term "QSO" >}}s remain in your local database.

## Daily Goal

Set a daily {{< term "QSO" >}} goal to track your progress.

### Configuring the Goal

In Activity Log settings, set **Daily QSO Goal** to your target number (e.g., 50).

### Progress Tracking

The Activity Log header displays:

> **37 / 50 QSOs today**

A progress bar fills as you approach the goal.

### Goal Reached Notification

When you log the {{< term "QSO" >}} that meets your goal, the app displays a congratulatory alert notification.

The notification appears once per day. Logging additional {{< term "QSO" >}}s beyond the goal does not trigger more alerts.

## Location Change Detection

The Activity Log monitors your {{< term "GPS" >}} location and detects when your grid square changes.

### Change Prompt

When the app detects a grid square change, a prompt sheet appears:

> **Location changed**
> FN42 → FN31 (47 miles)

Options:

- **Switch Profile** - Select a different station profile (e.g., mobile vs home)
- **Update Current Profile** - Update the existing profile's grid square
- **Ignore** - Continue using the current grid square

This ensures your {{< term "QSO" >}}s log with the correct location.

### Use Cases

- **Mobile operation** - Automatically updates grid as you move
- **Portable setups** - Switch profiles when arriving at a new site
- **Rove events** - Track grid changes during multi-location operations

## Daily Share Card

Share your day's activity on social media or with friends.

### Creating a Share Card

## Upload Services

Activity Log {{< term "QSO" >}}s sync to upload services differently than session-based logs.

### Supported Services

- **QRZ.com** - Uploads to your QRZ logbook
- **Ham2K LoFi** - Uploads to LoFi database

### POTA Upload Exclusion

**Activity Log {{< term "QSO" >}}s never upload to {{< term "POTA" >}}.**

Reason: {{< term "POTA" >}} uploads require an operator park reference (you must be activating a park). Activity Log is designed for hunters who are not at a park, so no park reference exists.

If you're activating a park, use the session-based Logger instead.

### Upload Timing

{{< term "QSO" >}}s queue for upload immediately upon saving. Sync happens in the background. Check Settings > Services to verify upload status.

## Activity Detection

Activity Log {{< term "QSO" >}}s trigger the same activity detection as session-based logs.

Detected activities include:

- **New {{< term "DXCC" >}} entity**
- **New band** (first contact on this band)
- **{{< term "DX" >}} contacts** (distance-based thresholds)
- **Streaks** (consecutive days with QSOs)

View detected activities in the Activity tab.

## Inline Editing

Modify logged {{< term "QSO" >}}s directly from the daily summary.

### Editing a QSO

Tap any {{< term "QSO" >}} row to open the edit sheet. Modify any field, then tap **Save** to update.

Changes sync to upload services automatically.

### Deleting a QSO

Swipe left on a {{< term "QSO" >}} row to reveal the **Delete** button.

A confirmation dialog appears to prevent accidental deletion. Confirm to remove the {{< term "QSO" >}} from the log and queue deletion sync to services.

## Settings

Access Activity Log settings from the Activity Log view or Settings > Activity Log.

### Station Profiles

Manage all station profiles:

- **Add Profile** - Create a new equipment configuration
- **Edit Profile** - Modify existing profiles
- **Delete Profile** - Remove unused profiles

Deleted profiles do not affect existing {{< term "QSO" >}}s logged with that profile.

### Upload Services

View which services are enabled for Activity Log uploads:

- QRZ.com status
- Ham2K LoFi status

Configure service credentials in Settings > Services.

### Daily Goal

Set your target {{< term "QSO" >}} count for each day.

Range: 1-999 {{< term "QSO" >}}s.

### Spot Age Threshold

Configure the maximum age (in minutes) for spots to appear in the spot list.

Range: 5-30 minutes. Default: 12 minutes.

### Spot Proximity Radius

When **Heard Nearby** is enabled, set the radius in miles.

Range: 100-2000 miles. Default: 500 miles.
