    <h1>Carrier Wave Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

    <h2>What Carrier Wave Does</h2>
    <p>Carrier Wave is an amateur radio QSO logging app. It helps you record contacts (QSOs), track POTA activations, and optionally sync your log with third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Carrier Wave collects only the data you provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Callsign and name</strong> &mdash; your amateur radio callsign and operator name, entered during setup</li>
        <li><strong>QSO logs</strong> &mdash; contact records you create (callsign, band, mode, timestamps, signal reports, park references, grid squares)</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> &mdash; used only to determine your Maidenhead grid square for logging; not stored or transmitted beyond grid derivation</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone audio</strong> &mdash; used for real-time CW (Morse code) decoding; audio is processed on-device and never recorded or transmitted</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong> &mdash; session photos you attach are stored locally on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>All QSO data is stored locally on your device using SwiftData. Credentials for third-party services are stored in the iOS Keychain. No data is stored on servers we operate, except as described under Community Features below.</p>
    <p>If you enable iCloud sync, your QSO database syncs across your Apple devices through your iCloud account, subject to Apple's privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Optional Cloud Sync</h2>
    <p>You may choose to sync your log with one or more third-party services. Carrier Wave only sends data to services you explicitly connect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>QRZ.com</strong> &mdash; uploads QSOs to your QRZ logbook</li>
        <li><strong>POTA (Parks on the Air)</strong> &mdash; uploads activation logs to pota.app</li>
        <li><strong>Ham2K LoFi</strong> &mdash; bidirectional QSO sync with your LoFi account</li>
        <li><strong>LoTW (Logbook of the World)</strong> &mdash; downloads confirmed QSOs from ARRL LoTW</li>
        <li><strong>Club Log</strong> &mdash; bidirectional QSO sync with your Club Log account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each service has its own privacy policy. Carrier Wave acts as a client and transmits only QSO data necessary for the sync.</p>

    <h2>Community Features (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you enable community features, your callsign and activity data (such as challenge participation, activity feed items, and friend connections) are stored on our activities server. You can delete your community account at any time from Settings, which permanently removes all your data from our server.</p>

    <h2>Analytics, Advertising, and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Carrier Wave does not include any analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking tools. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or behavioral information. There are no third-party SDKs in the app.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties. Data is only transmitted to services you explicitly choose to connect.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all QSO data from Settings at any time. If you use community features, you can delete your account from Settings &gt; Activities, which removes all server-side data. Uninstalling the app removes all local data.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Carrier Wave is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
